## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb NYC dataset from 2019 to better understand:

1. What can we learn about different hosts and areas?

2. What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)

3. Which hosts are the busiest and why?


## File Descriptions
There are 2 notebooks available here, one notebook gives answers to all the above questions and the second notebook is to predict the house or room price.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here.](https://medium.com/@poojapatel26/analysis-of-airbnb-data-nyc-2019-eecc84d9852a) 

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Airbnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
